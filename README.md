# DQLuck (kinda useless ngl lol)
Since i've been getting trash loot in dungeon quest i wanted to test my luck with ef items (for now)

`REMINDER: The chances are not 100% accurate for now because no one knows them and I tried to be the most accurate possible the legendaries may be accurate but for Eldenbark sets i'm pretty sure they're not for now`
